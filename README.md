# Wrist Steam
NOTE: AS OF JANUARY 2019, ANY AND ALL SUPPORT FOR STEAMPEBBLE IS DISCONTINUED DUE TO THE PEBBLE LINE OF HARDWARE BEING DISCONTINUED. ANY INTERESTED DEVELOPERS ARE STILL FREE TO FORK AND WORK WITH MY EXISTING PROJECT CONTRIBUTIONS AT THEIR LEISURE!

Hull Softworks'(Austin Hull's) open-source Pebble application is intended to - at least to a certain degree - bridge the gap between Steam users and their Pebble smart watches! 

Note: License details are currently present in all code files of this project, but may still be added to this readme later.

As the program is still not considered to be fully "feature complete", there may be lots of excess and redundant code in the program for purposes relating to testing, design, and implementation (in no particular order) of features.

I started this project during the summer after my junior year of highschool(2014), and have been working on it during my free-time ever since. Due to this, progress of development on this project may seem "erratic" compared to other works of software. As of now, I am mostly reserved to working on SteamPebble during extended breaks between school quarters.

The purpose of Wrist Steam is to help give Steam users of the Pebble wearer-base a closer connection between their two systems. Right now, the scope of the project simply involves taking a user's public ID data, and submitting it through Steam's API services in order to retrieve relevant user data to be displayed to the user through the Pebble watch. That being said, the project is certainly not designed without the possibility of further improvements and feature developments for later on.
